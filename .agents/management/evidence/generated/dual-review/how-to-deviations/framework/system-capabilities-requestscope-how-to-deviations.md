Generated: 2026-05-19T23:31:00+02:00

## 1. Review Unit Identity

- Review unit ID: RUF-018
- Root type: FRAMEWORK
- Path: `framework/System/Capabilities/RequestScope`
- Purpose inferred from code: `framework/System/Capabilities/RequestScope` owns the discovered reusable capability boundary boundary.
- Applicable how-to documents: all current `.agents/how-to/how-to-*.md`; non-authoritative backups and fixtures are inventoried globally but not used as local rule sources.

## 4. Exact Deviation Findings

No exact how-to deviation was recorded for this unit in the current evidence set.

This is not a blanket HOW_TO_COMPLIANT/GREEN claim; it means the pass produced no concrete deviation for this unit while global validation and ratchets remain required.

## 5. Deviations Summary

- Total deviations: 0
- BLOCKER count: 0
- HIGH count: 0
- MEDIUM count: 0
- LOW count: 0
- Blocked/unverifiable rules: none at file-read level; semantic proof is bounded by evidence above.
- Highest severity: NONE
- Decision: **HOW_TO_COMPLIANT**
