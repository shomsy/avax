## 4. Exact Deviation Findings

### How-To Deviation: FailureBoundary compiled policy files use raw file operations classified NEEDS_DESIGN_DECISION.

- Deviation ID: HTD-0044
- Review unit: `framework/System/Capabilities/FailureBoundary`
- Governance source: how-to-system-security.md §22; how-to-dogfooding.md Filesystem rule; check-raw-file-operations.php
- Required rule: security boundary must satisfy the cited how-to contract.
- Observed gap: FailureBoundary compiled policy files use raw file operations classified NEEDS_DESIGN_DECISION.
