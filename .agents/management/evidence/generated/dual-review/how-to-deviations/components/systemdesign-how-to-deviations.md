## 1. Review Unit Identity

- Review unit ID: RUC-085
- Root type: COMPONENT
- Path: `components/SystemDesign`
- Purpose inferred from code: `components/SystemDesign` owns the discovered runtime or user action flow boundary.
- Applicable how-to documents: all current `.agents/how-to/how-to-*.md`; non-authoritative backups and fixtures are inventoried globally but not used as local rule sources.

## 4. Exact Deviation Findings

### How-To Deviation: PublicSurface directly instantiates collaborators (18 `new` expressions detected).

- Deviation ID: HTD-0238
- Review unit: `components/SystemDesign`
- Governance source: how-to-design-components.md §6.2 PublicSurface Rule; how-to-dependency-injection.md §3.4
- Required rule: public API boundary must satisfy the cited how-to contract.
- Observed gap: PublicSurface directly instantiates collaborators (18 `new` expressions detected).
