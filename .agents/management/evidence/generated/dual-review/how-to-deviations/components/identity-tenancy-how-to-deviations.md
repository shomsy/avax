## 1. Review Unit Identity

- Review unit ID: RUC-053
- Root type: COMPONENT
- Path: `components/Identity/Tenancy`
- Purpose inferred from code: `components/Identity/Tenancy` owns the discovered runtime or user action flow boundary.
- Applicable how-to documents: all current `.agents/how-to/how-to-*.md`; non-authoritative backups and fixtures are inventoried globally but not used as local rule sources.
